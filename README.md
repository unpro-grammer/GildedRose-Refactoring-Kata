# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes). It was then translated into many programming languages (including the Java version used here) by Emily Bache (https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).  

I have also included a set of tests written by Sandra Parsick (https://github.com/sparsick) which can be used to ensure that nothing is broken while doing the refactoring exercise. 

The ["Gilded Rose Requirements"](https://github.com/kblincoe/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/main/GildedRoseRequirements.txt) explains what the code is for. These requirements are also included as comments in the ["GildedRoseTest.java"](https://github.com/kblincoe/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/main/src/test/java/com/gildedrose/GildedRoseTest.java) class.

## How to use this Kata

The simplest way is to just clone the code and start hacking away to improve the code. The idea is not to re-write the code from scratch, but rather to practice taking small refactoring steps, running the tests often, and incrementally improving the code.
